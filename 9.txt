Last week: Huffman compression (prefix codes, prefix free codes, sum of c frequencies time length). 

G = (V, E),

V = vertices, 

E = edge 

E contains V x V

(u,v) belongs to E (head tail). 

DIRECTED


E now is set (u, v)
degree of vertex is the # of neighbors

all vertices are reachable, u is reachable. These are connected v's. 
Strongly connected components are the set such that it's connected to u  and that v is re-reachable. All v's by default are strongly connected to themselves. 

A cycle is a nonempty path from a vertex to itself. 
Tree is a connected graph with no cycles

Distance is the shortest edge count in between. 

BREADTH FIRST SEARCH

Given a source vertex, computer all the distances from S (for all reachable vertices). From here, we can make a tree from the graph. 

Adjacency matric is a 1 if connected and 0 if not. Adjacency list can be shorter though.

BFS(graph, source)
grey = traversed
black = vertices already covered
white = unexplored

for all vertices:
	is white
